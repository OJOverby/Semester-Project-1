End of semester project for our first semester at Noroff. It is a website for a science museum.

## Description

Project brief provided from Noroff:
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

With this brief in mind this site was designed with a bright color palette consisting of blue, white and black. The design consists of a lot of images to give the visitors a feeling of what they can experience when visiting the museum. It was created using HTML, CSS and a little Javascript to add a few features that pure HTML would not allow.
